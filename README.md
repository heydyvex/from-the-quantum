From Quantum information to general intelligence
Exploring and learning from very first principle: Quantum physics to autonomous software (software 2.0) to General Intelligence (GI).

Objectives: Understanding **computation** and **information**, physics of them and broadly software on top of them.

What is the best way to make progress and learn and understand something? Problem solving with creativity a
How to understand new things? well:
- what is the *theory* or *idea* that you want to understand and learn or code?
- what was problem which one was trying to solve during the creation of the theory?
- simple: what was problem which scientist or engineer was trying to solve? Understanding that problem and solving it.
- simpler: what was the one's problem-situation during solving that particular problem that lead to a theory?
